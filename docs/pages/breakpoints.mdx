# Breakpoints

Glaze features a deep integration with GSAPs
[matchMedia](<https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.matchMedia()/>) functionality,
which allows you to define breakpoints and create responsive animations.

## Setup

To use breakpoints, you need to define them in the intialization of Glaze:

```js
new Glaze({
  gsap: { core: gsap },
  breakpoints: {
    sm: "(min-width: 640px)",
    md: "(min-width: 768px)",
  },
});
```

## Usage

Breakpoints are defined at the start of the animation string.

```html copy
<div data-animate="@sm:from:opacity-0"></div>
```

This will animate the opacity from 0 to 1 when the screen width is 640px or
more.

You can also define multiple breakpoints:

```html copy
<div data-animate="@sm:from:opacity-0 @md:from:yPercent-10"></div>
```

This will animate the `opacity` when the screen width is `640p`x or more, and
the `yPercent` + `opacity` when the screen width is `768px` or more.
